## Reporting a Vulnerability

I take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to me privately.

**Please do NOT open a public "Issue"** on GitHub.

Instead, please report it directly by using GitHub's **"Private Vulnerability Reporting"** feature.

1.  Go to the **"Security"** tab of this repository.
2.  Click on **"Report a vulnerability"**.
3.  Please include as much detail as possible in your report.

I will do my best to respond to your report within 48 hours.
